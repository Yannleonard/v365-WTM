# Castor — multi-host container orchestration platform (LEONARD-IT/GTEK-IT, Apache-2.0).
# Single self-contained image: a pure-Go static binary that serves both the
# JSON/WS API and the embedded React UI on one port (default :8080).
#
# Three stages:
#   1. ui    (node:24-alpine)            — build the React+Vite+TS UI to static assets.
#   2. build (golang:1.25.11-alpine)        — embed the UI dist + compile a CGO-free static binary.
#   3. final (distroless/static:nonroot) — ship only the binary, non-root, no shell, no libc.
#
# Multi-arch (linux/amd64 + linux/arm64) is trivial because the whole binary —
# including modernc.org/sqlite — is pure Go with CGO_ENABLED=0. mattn/go-sqlite3
# is FORBIDDEN (it needs cgo + libc and would break distroless/scratch + arm64 cross).
#
# Build locally:
#   docker buildx build --build-arg VERSION=$(git describe --tags --always) \
#     --build-arg COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) -t castor:dev --load .
#
# CRITICAL embed-path contract (must stay in lockstep across three agents):
#   - UI  : vite.config.ts  build.outDir = "../server/web/dist"
#   - GO  : server/web/embed.go has  //go:embed dist   (relative to that file)
#   - HERE: stage 1 writes /server/web/dist; stage 2 copies it to ./server/web/dist
#           BEFORE `go build`, so go:embed captures the freshly built assets.

# The CONTAINER starts as root, but the SERVER runs as NON-ROOT (uid 65532).
# `castor entrypoint` runs as root ONLY long enough to read the mounted docker
# socket's group, then immediately drops to uid:gid 65532:65532 WITH that group as
# a supplementary group and re-execs the server (the gosu/su-exec pattern, in pure
# Go for this shell-less distroless image). This is what lets
# `docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:... ghcr.io/.../castor` work with NO
# `--group-add` while the actual server process stays unprivileged.
#
# We must set USER 0 explicitly because the distroless :nonroot base defaults to
# uid 65532 — without this the entrypoint could not read a root:docker socket and
# the host would show "degraded". The drop to 65532 happens in-process; root is
# never retained by the server.
#
# Operators who prefer to pin the user can still run with
# `--user 65532:65532 --group-add <docker-gid>`: the entrypoint sees it is already
# non-root and simply runs the server without attempting to drop.
